# Backend with MySQL
### this project it's a simple example on how to create a backend with two different datatypes(books and users) that are stored in a SQL database. The structure is now little more complex, an user will register and log in and the backend will generate a token that will allow that user to access all the books stored in the database. The registered password is hashed in the DB and the token will be valid for 1 hour.

### install all the packages
### add your enviroment variables in the example.env, than rename it just .env 
### and run the server.

## thank you
